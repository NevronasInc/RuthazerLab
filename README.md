# RuthazerLab
Collection of converters for optophysiology, intracellular electrophysiology and axon branch growth datasets, to the NWB file format.

The metadata is collected from a template excel file where the lab members are expected to populate.
NOTE: The folder where the dataset to be converted is located, needs to match the identifier column entry from the excel sheet.

Optophysiology datasets were collected with a ThorLabs system and the patch clamp from a Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices) - Digitization: Digidata 1220 system.
